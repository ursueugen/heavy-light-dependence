# Analysis of heavy and light chain structural similarities

Approach

1. Get the structures in pdb satisfying the criteria (check data/screenshot*)

2. For each structure:
    a. Identify variable region, heavy variable, light variable structures
3. Sample pairs of structures:
    a. Compute RMSDs for variable region, V_heavy, V_light
4. Analyze results
